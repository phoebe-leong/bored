				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

				<p>
					I am Phoebe, a high school student and programmer from Australia. Currently I am extremely bored. It is 12:35am, and I should probably be asleep. However, I started this website a few hours ago and left it so I am intent on finishing it before I go to bed. You may go to my <a href="https://phoebe-leong.github.io">official website</a> if you wish, which is also linked above in the navigation bar. I do not have much else to say and am running out of ideas to type up, sadly.
					<br><br>
					I am not very good at programming, and have always wanted to be a low-level engineer with C++ and things like Arduino but it didn't work out. I may give it another shot but for now, 10th grade has just begun so I would like to focus more on that for the time being as the stakes are high. Goodnight.<br><br>
